# LA-Crime

This project analyzes Los Angeles crime data found at https://catalog.data.gov/dataset/crime-data-from-2020-to-present.

For this project we want to look at Los Angeles crime data from 2022 to present. We first want to look at trends in crime over time and location to determine where and when crimes are more likely to take place. This will consist of an analysis of total crimes committed across varying dates, times, and locations to determine specific combinations of factors that would suggests higher or lower rates of crime. In addition, we are interested in determining who is most at risk for particular types of crime, i.e., violent, property, etc. This will consist of an analysis of the number of crime types across differing gender and age.

We used code from https://thedatafrog.com/en/articles/show-data-google-map-python/ in using the google maps in API.
